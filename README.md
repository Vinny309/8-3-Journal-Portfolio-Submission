The app I developed is an inventory tracking application designed to authenticate users, manage inventory items, and provide low-stock notifications. It was created to address the user's needs for efficient inventory management and keeping track of stock levels.

The necessary screens and features for the app include a login screen, a grid view for displaying inventory, a settings and notifications screen, and a flow for adding items. The UI designs were user-centered, with a cohesive color scheme and a seamless flow between screens, ensuring a positive user experience.

In terms of coding, I initially attempted to add too many features at once, which proved to be a challenge. However, I learned to start with a working app and gradually implement features, a strategy I'll apply in the future.

Testing was essential, and I tested the app on various emulated devices to ensure functionality across different screen sizes, recognizing the importance of device compatibility.

Innovation was required to overcome initial challenges with screen flow and the notification system, but online tutorials and learning resources helped resolve these issues.

I found particular success in creating the login authentication screen and working with SQL and different database technologies. This experience has enhanced my knowledge and skills in database integration and working with various programming languages.
